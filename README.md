# Critias-FoliageSystem

About

'Critias Foliage System' is an system that is designed to paint, render and extract millions of instances of foliage without taking into account all the foliage but only the one that is in the proximity of the player. The flow is quite close to Unreal's foliage painter. Add your foliage to the system, set it's runtime settings and start painting!

In one word it makes possible huge forests of more than 100k trees, with wind, colliders and LODs, plus millions of real mesh grass (no billboards) with wind, fading and density settings.

Usage

The usage is quite simple and is carefully explained in the documentation.
